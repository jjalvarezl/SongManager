. G#m F# E B D#

[V]

.G#m        F#      E 
 I want you by my side
.B                    D#  
 So that I never feel alone again
.G#m            F#      E 
 They've always been so kind
.B                           D#  
 But now they've brought you away from here
.G#m          F#             E 
 I hope they didn't get your mind
.B                        D#  
 Your heart is too strong anyway
.G#m        F#             E 
 We need to fetch back the time
.B                     D#  
 They have stolen from us

[C]
.E 
 And I want you
.B
 We can bring it on the floor
.             D#               G#m
 You've never danced like this before
.         F#
 We don't talk about it
.E                  B
 Dancin' on, do the boogie all night long
.D#           G#m
 Stoned in paradise
.F#
 Shouldn't talk about it

.E 
 And I want you
.B
 We can bring it on the floor
.             D#               G#m
 You've never danced like this before
.         F#
 We don't talk about it
.E                  B
 Dancin' on, do the boogie all night long
.D#           G#m
 Stoned in paradise
 Shouldn't talk about it
 Shouldn't talk about it

.G#m        F#      E 
 Coldest winter for me
.B                 D#  
 No sun is shining anymore
.G#m        F#      E  
 The only thing I feel is pain
.B                 D#  
 Caused by absence of you
.G#m        F#      E  
 Suspence is controlling my mind 
.B                 D# 
 I cannot find the way out of here
.G#m        F#      E  
 I want you by my side 
.B                    D# 
 So that I never feel alone again
